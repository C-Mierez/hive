# HIVE

A Next.js project built for the purpose of trying out different technologies I've had my eye on for a while.

HIVE is a real-time collaborative whiteboard that allows users to draw and create elements on a canvas in real-time. It uses websockets to communicate between clients and the server, and uses a custom-built canvas to draw on. 

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)
- [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)

## Notes

This was done in the span of a single week. It is not meant to be a full-fledged product but just an MVP to test out the technologies.

I may come back to it in the future.
